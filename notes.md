Streamline the process of generating and accessing scripts based on ICD10 codes, with the ability to create and save custom scripts.

To allow optometrists to quickly find ICD10 codes and then immediately access or generate relevant scripts associated with those codes.

click a code, what are the options for
have a dropdown with scripts, menu of what I want to do
create a script for each disease that you use commonly.
'schedule a 3 month work up'
create a library of scripts.
be able to add a script, menu with options. Be able to copy and paste.
'Patient given X medication' 'Will return in X days'

User Flow (Revised):

The user opens the Opticode app and the ICD10 Code Lookup screen is displayed.
The user types in the search bar.
The results list updates.
The user clicks on a code in the list.
The Script Options Panel is populated with existing scripts (if any), and the selected code's details are briefly displayed.
The user either:
Selects an existing script from the dropdown (which opens the Script Editor with that script).
Clicks "Create New Script" (which opens the Script Editor with a new, blank script associated with the code).
Further Considerations:

Script Association: How will you initially associate existing scripts with ICD10 codes? This is an important data management question. Perhaps a separate screen or a feature within the Script Editor.
Script Templates: Consider allowing users to create script templates that can be quickly customized. This could speed up script creation.
